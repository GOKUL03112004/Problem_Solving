1 . dynamic programming ( dp)
a) divide the problem into sub problems
b) solve them 
c) store the answer in Variable/Array
d) reuse the prev results 
and calculate the next result 
e) avoid redundant computation 
F(5) =   calculating ==> 10 
F(5) = return 10 immediately
F(5) = return 10 
d) avoid recursion 
	  or,
 convert recursion into for loop


example: 
1)  Fibbonacci number generation using for loop 
2) Factorial calculation using for loop 
3) etc 




Greedy approach: 

1) In each iteration, find Locally optimal soln 
2) Aim for Global optimal soln (  ans)
